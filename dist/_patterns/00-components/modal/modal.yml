# Data for `modal.twig`

# Instantiate separate `attributes` objects for buttons.
# Otherwise, the changes to `attributes` from the first button bleed
# over into the subsequent buttons.
# I'm guessing this is due to PHP's handling of objects (using
# identifiers).
#
# The actual attributes are set in `modal.twig`, to keep the
# configuration in one place.
